You will more likely see a popup screen saying Application Blocked by Java Security. Please click on below link to show how to run jnlp file on your operating system. https://java.com/en/download/help/jcp_security.xml

<p>
Alternatively you can download jar file onto desktop and run via cmd or terminal using below commands: </p>
<p>java -jar jar-file </p>
<p>
Please note to run the jar file from cmd or terminal, you must be in the directory that the jar file has been downloaded to.

To download jar file click: https://github.com/mytimekumar/pairsgame and then click on pairsgame.jar in the repository, then in the next screen click view Raw save file to desktop.

Please note, I am still looking to add to this project possibly adding a timer. When selecting new game the cards are not shuffling correctly, so cards will show the same position i.e. game already playing. Thanks for looking at my project.
